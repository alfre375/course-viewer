# Get Started With Python
The good-ol' hello world is as follows:
```py
print("Hello, world!")
```
There are a few key notes:
- The `print` function is a builtin function that outputs a line of text to the console. By default, it also adds a newline character after the string
- No semicolon — python does not use semicolons
- The string `"Hello, world"`. String literals are declared in python with single or double quotes, and must use the same kind of quotation mark on both sides
